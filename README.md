# NZ Telecom Churn Simulation Project

## 1. Executive Summary
This project simulates how a New Zealand telecom provider could analyse and reduce customer churn using publicly available fictional CRM data. 
Because New Zealand telco CRM is confidential, a public dataset (JB-Link, Kaggle) is used solely as a proxy.  
The purpose is not only technical exploration but to demonstrate how data can support business insight, decision-making, and customer-focused retention thinking.

## 2. Business Context — Why Churn Matters in New Zealand

**Source:** Commerce Commission New Zealand — *Telecommunications Monitoring Report, 30 June 2025*

The New Zealand telecommunications market operates within a highly concentrated competitive structure. Three mobile network operators — 2degrees, Spark and One NZ — collectively hold approximately 97.5% of the mobile market, with 11 MVNOs serving only a comparatively small share of customers. In the broadband sector, the top three providers account for around 73% of connections, indicating similar concentration dynamics.

Infrastructure coverage across New Zealand is strong. Fibre is available to 100% of urban homes, and more than 90% of households have access to 4G fixed wireless. However, customer switching remains notably limited. Only around 11% of broadband households switched providers in the six months to June 2024, and nearly one-third of those who attempted to switch reported difficulty or dissatisfaction. Bundling products (such as broadband packaged with electricity) has further contributed to customer stickiness — cited by 11% of non-switchers as a reason for remaining with their provider.

### Why This Problem Matters

In a market where network availability and service performance no longer provide clear competitive differentiation, **customer retention becomes a fundamental lever for growth and financial stability**. Acquisition costs are typically several times higher than the cost of retention, meaning that even a modest reduction in churn (e.g., 5–10%) can translate into a meaningful uplift in annual revenue and customer lifetime value.

From a commercial standpoint, churn materially influences:

- revenue forecasting and financial planning
- customer-lifetime-value (CLV) modelling and prioritisation
- allocation of customer-operations and outbound contact resources
- performance and return-on-investment of marketing and CRM programmes
- product and pricing strategy — including bundling, data allowances, and plan structure

### Scope of This Project

Due to the absence of publicly available customer-level churn datasets in New Zealand, this project uses a fictional proxy dataset to **simulate how churn analytics would function inside a telecom provider**. The analytical flow replicates processes commonly used operationally when churn is treated as a strategic priority:

- identifying customers with a high likelihood of churn prior to departure
- analysing behavioural and demographic characteristics associated with churn
- segmenting customers to enable prioritised retention approaches
- translating findings into targeted commercial actions, including:
  - proactive retention outreach to high-risk segments
  - bundle recommendations designed to reduce churn likelihood
  - data-driven pricing or upgrade incentives aligned with demonstrated price sensitivity
  - operational improvements aimed at reducing switching friction (e.g., streamlined digital pathways)

The objective is to move beyond analytics for its own sake — instead demonstrating how insights could inform **commercial decisions**, whether quantifying revenue at risk, prioritising retention resources, or shaping investment into CRM programmes.

### How Insights Would Be Operationalised in Practice

Churn insights generated through this simulated workflow would typically support multiple internal teams, including:

- **Strategy and Finance** — modelling financial exposure, revenue at risk, and forecast improvement scenarios
- **Marketing and CRM** — designing targeted, data-driven retention campaigns and incentive structures
- **Customer Operations** — prioritising outbound contact lists and workload distribution
- **Product and Pricing** — refining plan tiers, bundle offerings, and service value propositions

This project is therefore positioned as a **representation of how churn analytics would be embedded into decision-making across a telecommunications organisation**, rather than as a stand-alone technical exercise.

## 3. Project Objective
This project aims to:
- explore patterns of churn using a proxy CRM dataset
- understand behavioural characteristics that may relate to churn
- develop a predictive or segmentation-based component
- most importantly, simulate how churn analysis could support real-world commercial thinking in Aotearoa New Zealand

## 4. Dataset and Ethical Disclaimer
Dataset: JB-Link fictional telecom CRM dataset (public Kaggle source)  
Reason for use: New Zealand telco CRM data is commercially confidential and cannot be shared publicly.  
Ethics: No real NZ customer data is used, and no dataset in this project contains personally identifiable information (PII). This project is a simulation only.
