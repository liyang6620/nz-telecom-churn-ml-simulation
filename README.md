# NZ Telecom Churn Simulation Project

## 1. Executive Summary
This project simulates how a New Zealand telecom provider could analyse and reduce customer churn using publicly available fictional CRM data. 
Because NZ telco CRM is confidential, a public dataset (JB-Link, Kaggle) is used only as a proxy.  
The purpose is to demonstrate how data can be translated into business insight, NZ-context decision-making, and customer-focused retention thinking — skills directly relevant to analyst and data science roles in New Zealand.

## 2. Business Context – Why Churn Matters in New Zealand
The New Zealand telecommunications market is highly concentrated — Spark, One NZ and 2degrees collectively hold more than 97% of the mobile market.  
Urban fibre availability is strong, yet approximately 170,000 households (around 10% of homes) still lack fixed broadband access, largely due to affordability and regional limitations.  
Switching behaviour is also limited — only about 11% of broadband users switched providers in the last year, and 32% of those who attempted switching experienced friction or dissatisfaction.

In this environment, retaining customers has significant commercial importance:
- acquiring a new customer can cost up to five times more than retaining an existing one
- a 10% reduction in churn could represent multi-million dollar annual value for a NZ telco

This project therefore frames churn not only as a predictive task, but as a commercial problem with financial and customer-experience implications.

## 3. Project Objective
The aim of the project is to:
- explore patterns of churn using a proxy CRM dataset
- understand behaviours and characteristics related to churn
- in later stages (optional) develop predictive components
- most importantly, simulate how churn analysis could support customer-focused business decisions in Aotearoa New Zealand

## 4. Dataset and Ethical Disclaimer
Dataset: JB-Link fictional telecom CRM dataset (public Kaggle source)

Why this dataset is used:  
New Zealand telco CRM data is commercially confidential and cannot be included in a public portfolio. A publicly available proxy dataset is therefore used for simulation purposes.

Ethical note:  
No real customer data is accessed.  
No dataset included here contains personally identifiable information (PII).  
This project is a simulation only.

## 5. Planned Workflow / Methodology
This structure outlines how work will progress:

1. Data ingestion – load the proxy dataset  
2. Exploratory data analysis – churn rates, tenure, billing patterns  
3. Customer segmentation – profiling and grouping  
4. Interpretation of churn drivers  
5. Contextualisation – link findings to NZ commercial environment  
6. (Optional) Predictive model development  
7. Business output – summarised insights and potential retention recommendations

This workflow is intentionally high-level until practical work begins.

## 7. Roadmap – Next Steps
Immediate actions:
- Upload dataset into `/data/`
- Create initial notebook: `notebooks/01_exploration.ipynb`
- Conduct descriptive churn analysis
- Begin NZ background notes in `/reports/nz-background.md`

Future work:
- Add baseline predictive model
- Add churn ROI calculator using NZ ARPU figures
- Build Tableau or Power BI dashboard
- Produce final summary PDF suitable for interviews

## 8. Purpose – Why This Repository Exists
This repository is part of a professional portfolio for data and analytics job applications in New Zealand.  
It is structured to demonstrate:
- commercial thinking
- communication and documentation skill
- NZ-specific context awareness
- the ability to plan and structure a realistic project
- and, later, technical ability through exploratory analysis and modelling
