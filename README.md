# NZ Telecom Churn Simulation Project

## 1. Executive Summary
This project simulates how a New Zealand telecom provider could analyse and reduce customer churn using publicly available fictional CRM data. 
Because New Zealand telco CRM is confidential, a public dataset (JB-Link, Kaggle) is used solely as a proxy.  
The purpose is not only technical exploration but to demonstrate how data can support business insight, decision-making, and customer-focused retention thinking.

## 2. Business Context — New Zealand Telecommunications Environment

New Zealand’s telecommunications market is highly concentrated. According to the Commerce Commission Telecommunications Monitoring Report (June 2025), three mobile network operators — 2degrees, Spark and One NZ — collectively hold 97.5% of the mobile market. There are 11 mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), but together they serve only a small, though growing, share of customers. The broadband market is somewhat less concentrated, with the top three providers holding 73% market share.

The competitive landscape has also shifted in recent years, including:
- the merger of Vocus and 2degrees (2022), increasing market concentration
- Mercury’s acquisition of Trustpower’s broadband business (2022–2023), driving bundled energy-broadband subscription growth

While fibre and wireless coverage is high — 100% of urban homes have fibre available and over 90% have access to 4G fixed wireless — customer switching remains relatively low. Only about 11% of broadband households changed providers in the six months to June 2024, and approximately one-third of those who attempted to switch experienced difficulty or dissatisfaction. Bundling is also a retention driver, with 11% of non-switchers citing bundled services as a reason for staying.

These indicators suggest churn in New Zealand is strongly shaped by:
- price sensitivity (switching often motivated by cheaper plans or more data)
- bundling (electricity-telco bundles reducing churn likelihood)
- structural market concentration (limited alternative providers in many cases)

This project therefore frames churn as a commercial decision-making problem within an Aotearoa context, grounded in:
- market structure and switching behaviour evidenced in the Commerce Commission report
- real consumer drivers (price, bundles, friction)
- NZ-specific telco characteristics rather than generic global telecom assumptions

## 3. Project Objective
This project aims to:
- explore patterns of churn using a proxy CRM dataset
- understand behavioural characteristics that may relate to churn
- develop a predictive or segmentation-based component
- most importantly, simulate how churn analysis could support real-world commercial thinking in Aotearoa New Zealand

## 4. Dataset and Ethical Disclaimer
Dataset: JB-Link fictional telecom CRM dataset (public Kaggle source)  
Reason for use: New Zealand telco CRM data is commercially confidential and cannot be shared publicly.  
Ethics: No real NZ customer data is used, and no dataset in this project contains personally identifiable information (PII). This project is a simulation only.
