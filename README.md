# NZ Telecom Churn Simulation Project

## 1. Executive Summary
This project simulates how a New Zealand telecom provider could analyse and reduce customer churn using publicly available fictional CRM data. 
Because New Zealand telco CRM is confidential, a public dataset (JB-Link, Kaggle) is used solely as a proxy.  
The purpose is not only technical exploration but to demonstrate how data can support business insight, decision-making, and customer-focused retention thinking.

## 2. Business Context — Why Churn Matters in New Zealand

New Zealand’s telecommunications market is highly concentrated. According to the Commerce Commission Telecommunications Monitoring Report (June 2025), three mobile network operators — 2degrees, Spark and One NZ — collectively hold 97.5% of the mobile market, while 11 MVNOs operate only at a small scale. The broadband market is somewhat less concentrated, with the top three providers holding 73% market share.

Despite strong infrastructure coverage — 100% of urban homes have fibre available and over 90% have access to 4G fixed wireless — customer switching remains low. Only around 11% of broadband households switched providers in the six months to June 2024, and nearly one-third of those who attempted to switch experienced difficulty or dissatisfaction. Bundling acts as a retention barrier, with 11% of non-switchers stating they stayed because broadband was bundled with another household service such as electricity.

### Why This Problem Matters
In a market where most customers already have access to fast connectivity and where infrastructure no longer differentiates providers, **competition increasingly depends on customer experience, value perception and retention strategies**. Acquiring a new user can cost several times more than retaining an existing one, meaning even a small reduction in churn (e.g., 5–10%) could translate into significant annual financial value for a New Zealand provider.

### What This Project Simulates and Aims to Solve
Because real customer-level churn data in NZ is not publicly available, this project simulates how a telco might:

- **identify customers who are at risk of leaving** before they churn  
- **understand which behavioural and demographic factors drive churn** (e.g., price sensitivity, low usage, dissatisfaction indicators)  
- **design targeted retention strategies**, such as:
  - proactive outreach to high-risk users
  - bundle offers that actually respond to NZ consumer behaviour
  - discounts or plan upgrades where price sensitivity is detected
  - reducing switching friction through clearer pathways or digital self-service  

Through this project, churn is treated not as a purely technical prediction task, but as a **commercial decision-making problem**, answering the question:

> *“If I were a NZ telco, how would I use data to keep customers longer and increase revenue?”*

### How This Connects to Real-World Roles
A hiring manager reading this project should be able to see evidence of:
- commercial problem framing
- understanding of NZ market realities
- ability to turn data into actions, not just charts or models
- skills in communication, business interpretation, and analytical workflow

## 3. Project Objective
This project aims to:
- explore patterns of churn using a proxy CRM dataset
- understand behavioural characteristics that may relate to churn
- develop a predictive or segmentation-based component
- most importantly, simulate how churn analysis could support real-world commercial thinking in Aotearoa New Zealand

## 4. Dataset and Ethical Disclaimer
Dataset: JB-Link fictional telecom CRM dataset (public Kaggle source)  
Reason for use: New Zealand telco CRM data is commercially confidential and cannot be shared publicly.  
Ethics: No real NZ customer data is used, and no dataset in this project contains personally identifiable information (PII). This project is a simulation only.
