# NZ Telecom Churn Simulation Project

## 1. Executive Summary
This project simulates how a New Zealand telecom provider could analyse and reduce customer churn using publicly available fictional CRM data. 
Because New Zealand telco CRM is confidential, a public dataset (JB-Link, Kaggle) is used solely as a proxy.  
The purpose is not only technical exploration but to demonstrate how data can support business insight, decision-making, and customer-focused retention thinking.

## 2. Business Context – Why Churn Matters in New Zealand
The New Zealand telecommunications market is highly concentrated — Spark, One NZ and 2degrees together account for the vast majority of mobile and broadband connections.  
Urban fibre availability is strong, yet approximately 170,000 households (around 10% of NZ homes) still lack fixed broadband access due to regional and affordability constraints.  
Switching behaviour is limited — only around 11% of broadband users changed providers in the past year, and about one-third of those experienced difficulty or dissatisfaction when switching.

Given these conditions, retaining customers is commercially important. Acquisition can cost several times more than keeping existing users, and churn reduction — even at modest levels — can translate into meaningful financial outcomes for a NZ provider.

## 3. Project Objective
This project aims to:
- explore patterns of churn using a proxy CRM dataset
- understand behavioural characteristics that may relate to churn
- later (optional) develop a predictive or segmentation-based component
- most importantly, simulate how churn analysis could support real-world commercial thinking in Aotearoa New Zealand

## 4. Dataset and Ethical Disclaimer
Dataset: JB-Link fictional telecom CRM dataset (public Kaggle source)  
Reason for use: New Zealand telco CRM data is commercially confidential and cannot be shared publicly.  
Ethics: No real NZ customer data is used, and no dataset in this project contains personally identifiable information (PII). This project is a simulation only.
